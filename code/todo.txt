- In our main file, we need to make a data struct to hold the data objects
- We need to create a results struct to hold results objects 
- Overall, need to translate the contents of the binary files iv.mat, ps2.mat, and mvalold.mat. I am not clear on exactly how these were constructed in the first place (obviously with Matlab, but the documentation is opaque as to how to replicate)
